# Multimodal AI Assistant and Extended Reality (XR) Applications

## Project Description

This project explores the integration of Vision Language Model (VLM), Large Language Model (LLM), and extended reality (XR) to create a Multimodal AI assistant with voice chat, Image understanding, and smart building control in immersive environments. This project aims to create an innovative solution for remote facility management and urban infrastructure monitoring. The developed system deploys an LLM-based AI assistant and a digital building twin into an XR environment using Microsoft HoloLens 2. Users can interact with the BIM models and communicate with the Multimodal AI chatbot. Users can also interact with the AI assistant through voice commands to control building facilities. This setup enhances the ability of facility managers and occupants to interact with and control smart buildings remotely. The approach also holds the potential for scaling to multiple buildings or urban infrastructure, enabling immersive, real-time monitoring and management for smart city applications.
